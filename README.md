# zDSH FileHub

**The unified file center for DeepSeek Harness.**

Upload anywhere, reference anything with `@`, let the model read your documents,
caption your images — and manage every file across all sessions from one console.

## Why FileHub

DeepSeek Harness ships a great multimodal chat experience, but everything
non-image lives at the edges: there is no click-to-upload button, no generic
(non-image) upload channel, no way for the model to open a PDF or spreadsheet,
and no place to see the files a session has produced.

FileHub closes those gaps with one batteries-included plugin:

- **Four upload entries** feeding one queue — button, full-page drag & drop,
  paste, and whole folders with hierarchy preserved.
- **`@` file mentions done right** — candidates are ranked instantly from a
  bounded workspace index *and* your uploaded files, and every mention is
  existence-checked when the message is sent, then injected as a structured
  reference. The model sees exactly which file you mean — never its contents
  unless it asks.
- **Document reading for the model** — `read_document` opens text, PDF,
  DOCX and XLSX with pagination, per-format output budgets and explicit
  truncation markers, so long documents are traversed on demand instead of
  flooding the context window.
- **Image captioning waterfall** — if your active route is multimodal, images
  pass straight through untouched; otherwise captions come from a local Ollama
  instance by default. Zero bytes leave your machine unless you say so.
- **A real file console** — every session's files, searchable and filterable,
  with storage stats and two-step-confirmed cleanup.

## Features

### Upload channel

| Entry | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Composer button | Multi-select file picker |
| Drag & drop | Full-page overlay, recursive directory traversal, relative paths preserved |
| Paste | Any clipboard files, not just images |
| Queue dock | Per-item progress, retry, cancel, remove (removal deletes server-side too) |

Transfers are streaming with double enforcement of size caps, a concurrency
gate, and per-session quotas. Content-addressed deduplication means uploading
the same file twice never stores it twice. Files land in an isolated session
workspace (`.filehub/<sessionId>/`) that the agent can reach with its normal
file tools and the sandbox already covers.

### @ file mentions

Type `@` in the composer to search both the workspace index and files uploaded
in the current session. Candidates show type icons, disambiguated parent paths
and full keyboard navigation. At send time each mention token is validated
against the filesystem (path traversal rejected) and expanded into a structured
`<workspace-reference>` message — invalid paths are surfaced, never silently
dropped. A chip bar above the composer tracks every referenced file and lets
you remove one precisely.

### AI document reading

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read_document` | Read text/PDF/DOCX/XLSX with `offset`/`limit` pagination, `sheet` selection, and a `probe` mode that returns structure (page count, sheet list, sizes) without dumping content |
| `list_workspace_files` | List the session workspace (bounded, with truncation flag) |

Per-format character budgets keep responses predictable; truncated reads carry
an explicit continuation marker teaching the model how to fetch the next slice.
Parsed content is cached content-addressed, so repeated reads of the same file
cost nothing.

### Image captioning

When the active route declares `image` in its input modalities, FileHub steps
aside completely — native multimodal behavior is untouched. Otherwise captions
are produced through a strict waterfall: explicit endpoint (public HTTPS only)
→ local Ollama probe (loopback only, on by default) → gracefully off. Results
are cached per image hash; concurrent uploads of the same picture trigger
exactly one caption call.

### File console

The conversation view gains a **Files** tab aggregating every session: search
and type filters, per-session grouping, storage usage breakdown, and cleanup
actions guarded by a dry-run preview plus confirmation. The assistant message
menu also offers quick actions built on the same store.

## Installation

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add https://github.com/zsagi1368/zdsh-filehub
```

That's it — the bundled manifest wires up both halves automatically. No manual
configuration is required; sensible defaults apply everywhere.

## Configuration

Everyday options live in **Settings → FileHub** inside the web UI (language,
paste handling, candidate limit, privacy toggles). Server-side tuning accepts
a profile config object:

```ts
{
  storageDirName: '.filehub',            // session-workspace subdirectory
  upload: {
    maxBytes: 50 * 1024 * 1024,          // single-file cap (streaming-enforced)
    maxConcurrent: 4,                    // parallel transfer gate
    perSessionQuotaBytes: 512 * 1024 * 1024,
    // dangerousExtensions: [...],       // optional deny-list override
  },
  lifecycle: {
    ttlMs: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,      // retention window
    sweepIntervalMs: 60 * 60 * 1000,     // sweeper cadence (all sessions)
  },
  mention: {
    indexMaxFiles: 5000,                 // bounded index hard stop
    indexTtlMs: 30_000,                  // staleness fallback
    searchLimit: 50,
  },
  reading: {
    budgets: { /* per-format char budgets */ },
    cacheEntries: 64,
    cacheBytes: 256 * 1024 * 1024,
  },
  vision: {
    mode: 'off' | 'caption' | 'analyze',
    endpoint: undefined,                 // public http(s) captioning endpoint
    ollamaProbe: true,                   // loopback-only local fallback
    timeoutMs: 20_000,
  },
  console: { maxEntries: 2000 },
}
```

## Security

FileHub handles user files, so security claims here are backed by named tests
(`tests/adversarial/`) rather than prose:

- **Path sandbox** — resolve-then-containment assertions with `realpath`
  re-checks on both endpoints of every operation; immune to symlink/junction
  escapes, sibling-prefix tricks, ADS payloads and Windows drive-relative
  path traps.
- **SSRF fences** — local probes are locked to loopback addresses; remote
  endpoints must be public hosts verified after DNS resolution; redirects are
  refused, not followed.
- **Same-origin hardening** — Origin hostname comparison plus remote-address
  loopback verification.
- **Resource limits** — streaming size caps, concurrency gate, per-session
  quota, TTL sweeper that provably visits *all* sessions.

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the claim-by-claim evidence map.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install   # host types resolve via link:../Fork/* (needs a sibling DeepSeek Harness checkout)
pnpm run check # typecheck + test + build
```

The build produces the ESM host half and the single-file client bundle served
by the harness web server. `docs/integration-playbook.md` documents the seams
for embedding FileHub as a first-party extension of a distribution branch.
